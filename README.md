# Rules of the game
To refer to the rules of the game, refer to the PDF in the link below:
https://ctycms.com/mn-rochester/docs/checkers-instructions.pdf

If you're too lazy to open the link, the rules are given below:
- The opponent with the darker pieces moves first.

- Pieces may only move one diagonal space forward (towards their opponents pieces) in the
  beginning of the game.

- Pieces must stay on the dark squares.

- To capture an opposing piece,"jump" over it by moving two diagonal spaces in the direction of
  the the opposing piece.

- A piece may jump forward over an opponent's pieces in multiple parts of the board to capture
  them.

- Keep in mind, the space on the other side of your opponentâ€™s piece must be empty for you to
  capture it.

- If your piece reaches the last row on your opponent's side, you may re-take one of your captured
  pieces and "crown"the piece that made it to the Kings Row. Thereby making it a "King Piece."

- King pieces may still only move one space at a time during a non-capturing move. However,
  when capturing an opponent's piece(s) it may move diagonally forward or backwards.

- There is no limit to how many king pieces a player may have.

## The game is won when all of your opponent's pieces are captured !!
